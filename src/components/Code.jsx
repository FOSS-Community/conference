        PyDelhiConf is a community organized conference intended for advocating
        the use and adoption of the Python programming language in India. It is
        also a platform for fostering networking and collaboration among the
        Python developer community in India. We value the participation of every
        member of the Python community and want all attendees to have an
        enjoyable and rewarding experience. Accordingly, every attendee of the
        conference is expected to show respect and courtesy to every other
        attendee throughout the conference and at all conference related events,
        whether officially organized by PSSI or not. To make clear what is
        expected, all delegates/attendees, speakers, exhibitors, organizers and
        volunteers at PyDelhiConf are required to conform to the following Code
        of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.
